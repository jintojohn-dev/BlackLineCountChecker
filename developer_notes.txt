UNEXPECTED PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

Problem
- Pure black pixel detection (RGB = 0,0,0) was used in the initial implementation.
- Some images (e.g., image_2 and image_4) contained slight pixel variations, causing inconsistent recognition of black pixels.

Impact
- Strict equality checks (RGB == 0) failed to detect lines correctly in JPEGs.
- Example results:
	- Image 2 -> detected 5 lines (incorrect).
	- Image 4 -> detected 8 lines (incorrect).
- These results did not align with the expected line counts

Solution
- Introduced a configurable black threshold (default: 50).
- Pixels with RGB values below the threshold are treated as “black.”
